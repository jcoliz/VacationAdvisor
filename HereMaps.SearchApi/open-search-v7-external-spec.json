They can change or in rare cases be removed.\n  No backward compatibility is guaranteed nor bug service level agreement (SLA) do apply.\n  Customers using ALPHA features are advised not use them in production.\n- \"BETA\" tagged features are in end-stage development. They are backward compatible and can not be removed.\n  They have no major bug, but coverage, quality, performance, or test coverage is not considered final.\n  customers can safely use BETA features in their applications if they accept those limitations and potential behavior refinements.\n\n### \"RESTRICTED\" tag\n\nAPI requests parameters and response fields can be tagged with the privilege qualifier \"RESTRICTED\".\nSuch features are only available to customers having a specific contract with HERE.\nUnauthorized usages are typically leading to a http status code 403.\n\n\n",

One is the\n  access point (or navigation coordinates), which is the point to\n  start or end a drive. The other point is the position or display\n  point. This point varies per source and country.

For\n  interpolated addresses, we cannot say with confidence that the\n  address exists in reality.

This result\n  type is only returned by Lookup endpoint or Geocode endpoint when\n  `with=MPA` parameter is provided.\n- `PA`: A Point Address represents an individual address as a point object.\n  Point Addresses are coming from trusted sources. We can say with\n  high certainty that the address exists and at what position. A\n  Point Address result contains two types of coordinates. One is the\n  access point (or navigation coordinates), which is the point to\n  start or end a drive. The other point is the position or display\n  point. This point varies per source and country. The point can be\n  the rooftop point, a point close to the building entry, or a point\n  close to the building, driveway or parking lot that belongs to the\n  building.\n- `interpolated`: An interpolated address. These are approximate positions as a\n  result of a linear interpolation based on address ranges. Address\n  ranges, especially in the USA, are typical per block. For\n  interpolated addresses, we cannot say with confidence that the\n  address exists in reality. But the interpolation provides a good\n  location approximation that brings people in most use cases close\n  to the target location. The access point of an interpolated address\n  result is calculated based on the address range and the road\n  geometry. The position (display) point is pre-configured offset\n  from the street geometry. Compared to Point Addresses, interpolated\n  addresses are less accurate.",
